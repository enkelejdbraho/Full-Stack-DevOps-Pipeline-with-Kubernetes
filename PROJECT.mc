Project: Full-Stack DevOps Pipeline with Kubernetes
Goal: Deploy a microservices-based application with a complete DevOps lifecycle.

Tools Included:
GITHUB ACTIONS

Running tests and building Docker images
Pushing images to Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry
Terraform – 

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Kubernetes (K8s) –
Container orchestration

Prometheus & Grafana – 

Monitoring & alerting
Fluent Bit & Elasticsearch
Logging & observability

Project Workflow:
Version Control & CI/CD Pipeline (GitLab CI/CD)
Developers push code to GitLab.
GitLab CI/CD builds Docker images and pushes them to a registry.
Deploys application to Kubernetes using Helm.
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Terraform provisions the Kubernetes cluster on AWS (EKS) or local (kind/minikube).
Deploys networking, security policies, and storage.
Kubernetes for Orchestration

Manages microservices (backend, frontend, database).
Uses Ingress for external access.
Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

Prometheus scrapes metrics from Kubernetes.
Grafana visualizes metrics & sets alerts.
Logging with Fluent Bit & Elasticsearch

Fluent Bit collects logs from containers.
Sends logs to Elasticsearch for analysis.
Tech Stack & Requirements:
Cloud: AWS/GCP (or local setup using Minikube/K3s)
CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD pipelines
IaC: Terraform
Containers: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
Logging: Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch
